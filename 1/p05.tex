\begin{problem}{\problemnum \, \textsf{(POOLE 1.3.14)}}
    Give the vector equation of the plane passing through $P$, $Q$, and $R$.
    \[
        P = (1, 0, 0),
        Q = (0, 1, 0),
        R = (0, 0, 1)
    \]
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}\\
    The vector form of the equation of a plane in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is:
    \[ \bx = \mathbf{p} + s\bu + t\bv \]
    Reifying:
    \[ \bx = \vvv{1}{0}{0} + s\vvv{0}{1}{0} + t\vvv{0}{0}{1}\]
\end{solution}

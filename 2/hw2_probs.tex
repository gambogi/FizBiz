\begin{problem}{\problemnum}
In class we learnt how to use projections to find the distance of a point to a line or a point to a plane (you may also want to see \textbf{example 1.32 and 1.33}) in your textbook. Here we want to use similar ideas by finding the (perpendicular) distance between two lines.

Suppose we are given two lines $L_1$ and $L_2$ as follows:
\[\br_1=\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\\-2 \end{bmatrix}+s\begin{bmatrix}4\\1\\3 \end{bmatrix} \qquad \text{ and } \qquad \br_2=\begin{bmatrix}2\\-1\\0\end{bmatrix}+t\begin{bmatrix}2\\1\\0\end{bmatrix}.\]
To find the distance between these two lines we will follow the following recipe:
\begin{enumerate}
\item First find a vector $\mathbf{n}=(a,b,c)$ that is orthogonal to the direction vectors of both the lines. 
\item Then choose an arbitrary point $P$ on $L_1$ and an arbitrary point $Q$ on $L_2$. Find the vector $\overrightarrow{PQ}$.
\item Now use appropriate projections to find the distance between the two lines. 
\end{enumerate} 
\textsf{\red NOTE:} This technique cannot work in higher dimensions ($\geq 4$) because (as we have seen previously) for dimensions $\geq 4$, the vector $\mathbf{n}$ need not be unique.

Consider the system of equations:
\systeme[xyzw]{-w+2y+x=a, 2x+z= b, x+6y-z-3w=c} %%% systeme will specify variables alphabetically but by putting the optional [xyzw] we can specify the order of variables
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The \textsf{row picture} of this system can be described as the intersection of \textbf{three 3D hyperplanes} in the 4D space. How will you describe the \textsf{column picture} of this system?
	\item Find the condition on the parameters $a, b \textrm{ and } c$ so that the system is consistent.
	\item Does the system have a solution when $a=3, b=1$ and $c=-1$? If yes, then find the solution in vector form.
	\item Does the system have a solution when $a=0, b=1$ and $c=-1$? If yes, then find the solution in vector form.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{exactly one} solution? \textbf{infinitely} many solutions?

\]
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Find all the values of $x$ and $y$ for which the \textbf{augmented matrix} $[\bA | \bb]$ has exactly two pivots.

	\begin{enumerate}
	\item If possible, give an example of a $3 \times 4$ matrix $\bA$ and $3 \times 1$ columns $\bb$ and $\bc$ such that $[\bA | \bb]$ is an augmented matrix for an inconsistent system but $[\bA | \bc]$ is an augmented matrix for a consistent system.
	\item Suppose a system of linear equation has $3 \times 5$ \textsf{augmented matrix} whose fifth column is a pivot column. Is the system consistent? (give reasons for your answer).
	\item Suppose a system of linear equation has $3 \times 5$ \textsf{coefficient matrix} with three pivot columns. Is the system consistent? (give reasons for your answer).
	\end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}{\problemnum}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Suppose $\bA$ is a matrix such that $[\bA|\bu]$ and $[\bA|\bv]$ are both CONSISTENT systems. Show that $[\bA|(\bu+\bv)]$ is also a consistent system. \textit{(Hint: think in terms of column picture.)}
    \item Let \[\bu =
          \begin{bmatrix}
            0 \\
            2 \\
            4 \\

    \bv =        \begin{bmatrix}
          1 \\
          3 \\
          5 \\
          7 \\
        \end{bmatrix}
    \]
Suppose $\bA$ is a matrix such that $[\bA|\bu]$ and $[\bA|\bv]$ are both INCONSISTENT systems. Is it possible that $[\bA|(\bu+\bv)]$ is a consistent system with infinitely many solutions.
If ``YES'', then give an example of such a matrix $\bA$ and show that it satisfies all the conditions given. If ``NO'', then give a reason why would such a matrix $\bA$ not exist.

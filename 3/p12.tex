\begin{problem}{\problemnum}
Let $S=\{\bv_1, \bv_2, \bv_3\}$ be a linearly independent set of vectors. For what value of $k$ will the set $T=\{\bv_2-\bv_1, k\bv_3-\bv_2, \bv_1-\bv_3\}$ be linearly independent.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{\problemnum}
Let $S=\{\bv_1, \bv_2, \bv_3, \bv_4\}$ be a set of four non-zero vectors in $\bbR^{10}$ such that they are pairwise orthogonal to each other (i.e. $\bv_i \cdot \bv_j=0$ for $i \neq j$). Prove that the set $S$ is a linearly independent set. You should start with $x_1\bv_1+ \dotsb + x_4\bv_4=\mathbf{0}$ and then prove that the ONLY solution for this is $x_1=\ldots=x_4=0$ (the zero solution).

%% commands defined by me or edit the style file appropriately.

%%\end{center}
%%\item Let $\bx$ be a vector such that $\bx=\bu+5\bv+12\bw$, where $\bu, \bv$ and $\bw$ are vectors in $\bbR^n$. Show that $\bx \in \text{Span}(\bu+\bv, \bv+\bw, \bw+\bu)$.

%%\item
%%\textbf{Linear independence and dependence} are properties of sets. So
%%one can ask questions related to set theoretic operations. If the following statements are true then give a proof of it, otherwise give a counterexample with complete explanation of how it violates the statement.\\
%% If $A$ and $B$ are two sets of linearly independent vectors in
%% $\bbR^n$ then
%% \begin{enumerate}
%%    \item Can $A \cap B$ be linearly independent? Must it be.
%%    \item Can $A \cup B$ be linearly independent? Must it be.
%% \end{enumerate}
%%
%%\item Suppose $\bv_1, \bv_2, \bv_3, \bv_4$ are vectors in $\bbR^n$ such that $\bv_1+2\bv_2+\bv_3+\bv_4=\mathbf{0}$.
%%\begin{enumerate}
%%    \item If $\bw = c_1\bv_1 + c_2\bv_2 +c_3\bv_3 + c_4\bv_4$, then express $\bw$ as a linear combination of $\bv_1, \bv_2, \bv_3$ only.
%%    \item Show that span($\bv_1,\bv_2, \bv_3) = \mbox{span}(\bv_1, \bv_2, \bv_3, \bv_4)$.
%%\end{enumerate}
%%
%%\item
%%\begin{enumerate}
%%    \item Show that any set of $4$ vectors in $\bbR^2$ is always linearly dependent.
%%    \item Does the same thing hold for a set of $5$ vectors? What about $3$ vectors? Do you see a general phenomenon related to the number
%%        of solutions of a homogeneous system.
%%    \item What is the most number of elements a linearly independent subset of $\bbR^2$ can have?
%%\end{enumerate}
%%
%%\item Determine the value(s) of $a$ such that $\left\{\begin{pmatrix} 1\\ a\end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} a\\ a+2\end{pmatrix}\right\}$ is a linearly independent set.
%%
%%\item How many pivot columns must a $7 \times 5$ matrix have if its columns are linearly independent? Why? Will your answer change if it was $5 \times 7$ matrix? Why?
